i struggled with them in the beginning but I'm ok with them now.
1. How much time did you spend on this lesson/topic? How did that line up with your time estimate? i had the most trouble with my laptop and me programs i needed to use. the actual work in the lesson didn't take that long. i defiantly spent longer on this course than expected.

1. What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need? I don't have any at this time. I will search google and ask technical questions when needed.
